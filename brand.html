            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>
                We are a pack of vagabonds floating through this perilous existence, and our drop-tuned chords will shatter your fragile reality,
                along with your eardrums if you forget to wear earplugs at our shows, because what good is an amp if we don't turn it up all the way?
            </p>
            <p>
                Inspired by grunge anti-heroes, post-hardcore wimps, and the infinite gaping mouth of the void, we are destined to defeat all our doubters 
                in our campaign to bring an end to the status quo that is keeping us all down, and fight evil corporations unless they agree to sponsor our tour.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whatever you do, just don't label us "shoegaze" - although we admire some bands with that label and go to great lengths to imitate them,
                you can't put us in a tidy little box, music critics of the internet! We totally don't care if you have more followers than our page... not at all...
            </p>
